# 1. Introduction

## Karma: A Decentralized DAO Promoting Good Deeds
In today's fast-paced world, acts of kindness and goodwill often go unnoticed and unrewarded. Karma seeks to change this by creating a decentralized platform that incentivizes and recognizes good deeds through the use of blockchain technology. By leveraging the power of DAOs and tokenomics, Karma aims to promote a global culture of altruism and social responsibility.

Karma is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with the mission to encourage the spread of good karma worldwide through an incentivization system and integrations with external applications. The functions of the DAO include certifying external protocols that wish to integrate and rewarding users who engage with these protocols with Karma tokens (KRM).

Karma is not just a token, but a symbol of status. Its minting process is deliberately challenging, and selling it proves to be even more arduous. The Proof-of-Karma (PoK) is a metric that quantifies the extent to which an individual has invested in social welfare initiatives.

## Tokenomics
Karma's tokenomics are represented by two coins: **KRM (Karma Token)** and **GLDKRM (Gold Karma Token)**.

### KRM
KRM is a KRC-20 token that starts with an initial supply of zero and organically grows as individuals engage in good deeds via protocols tied to the Karma ecosystem. The concept of Proof-of-Karma (PoK) encapsulates the contributions made by an individual towards societal welfare.

Karma serves more as a status symbol than a token with monetary value. Its issuance is governed by transactions approved by the DAO, making it particularly challenging to acquire, transfer, or sell. Upon transfer, 80% of the supply is intentionally burned to maintain its value and rarity.

The primary philosophy behind Karma is that it should be earned through genuine contribution and should not be easily transferable or sellable. The burn rate of the transferred supply, set at 80%, is a parameter determined by the DAO, emphasizing the difficulty and significance of possessing Karma.

### GLDKRM
While KRM tokens represent social commitment, Golden Karma (GLDKRM) is a coin with a hard cap of 100,000,000. Its purpose is to incentivize investors to participate in the network and earn dividends. Holders of GLDKRM can collect dividends generated by the DAO in proportion to their holdings, stimulating active participation and support within the network.

From the contributions made to the DAO, a proportion of 60% is allocated as a reward to the voters, reinforcing their commitment to the network. The remaining 40% is distributed among GLDKRM token holders, further incentivizing token ownership.

Among the total tokens, 20% are earmarked for the DAO founders to address private needs and strategic initiatives. The rest, 80%, is made available for purchase from the designated smart contract. The revenue derived from this sale is deployed for network development and maintenance.

The exchange rate is set at 1 USDC for every 100 GLDKRM. This is with a goal to raise $800,000, a sum necessary to finance the development for production release, marketing activities, and management of various initiatives, laying a strong foundation for the Karma ecosystem's success.

# 2. NFT Marketplace

One use case of integration with the DAO is the NFT marketplace ([try it]()) implemented by the KCHAIN Solutions.

A Kollection Creator can publish NFTs and Kollections on the marketplace, representing various initiatives such as remote adoption (e.g., stray animals in shelters), a time marketplace, a skill marketplace, and other projects that require funding.

For each NFT, the Kollection Creator can update the progress of their project by posting updates.

If a Kollection Creator requests certification from the DAO, the DAO oversees the quality of the services offered and has the authority to revoke minting or trading permissions for the NFTs. When a Kollection is certified by the Karma DAO, a KRM token is attached to each NFT transaction for the buyer and the seller.

Additionally, The buying and selling of NFTs generate four different types of fees:

* Seller's profit
* Commission to the Kollection Creator
* Royalties to any beneficiaries (optional)
* Donation to the Karma DAO to sustain the protocol's usage
  
Donations to the Karma DAO are then distributed between voting members (60%) and investors holding GLDKRM (40%). Investors receive dividends proportional to their GLDKRM balance.

The platform is designed to be fully decentralized, hence all the metadata describing the NFT are managed through [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).

An helper for data upload via [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) has been implemented.

Here is the sequence diagram of the use case implemented.

## 3. Conclusion
In summary, Karma is an innovative DAO aiming to foster the widespread distribution of good karma through its incentivization model. By integrating with external protocols and rewarding users with KRM tokens, Karma incentivizes individuals to perform positive actions, creating a virtuous cycle of goodwill. Additionally, the introduction of GLDKRM provides an opportunity for investors to participate and contribute to the network's growth while reaping dividends. With its unique tokenomics and decentralized approach, Karma is set to make a meaningful impact on the world by spreading positivity and rewarding social responsibility.
